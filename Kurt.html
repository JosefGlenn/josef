               <p align="justify">Kurt Cobain was born on February 20, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington, to Donald and Wendy Cobain. From an early age, he showed a deep interest in music and art, often drawing cartoon characters and listening to classic rock bands like The Beatles. His childhood was marked by a mix of creativity and emotional sensitivity, but his life took a difficult turn when his parents divorced in 1975. The divorce deeply affected Kurt, leaving him feeling abandoned and angry. He became more withdrawn and rebellious, struggling to find stability as he moved between different family members' homes. Despite the emotional challenges, his passion for music grew stronger. By his early teens, he had discovered bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and the punk rock scene, which resonated with his sense of frustration and alienation. At age 14, he received his first guitar and began writing songs, setting the foundation for his musical journey. During high school, he became involved in Aberdeen's small punk scene, attending shows and forming connections with other musicians. Though he dropped out of high school before graduation, his dedication to music never wavered. In the years leading up to Nirvana's formation, Kurt immersed himself in punk music, particularly inspired by bands like the Melvins, who became a gateway to the larger punk community in the Pacific Northwest.

<p align="justify">Kurt Cobain discovered punk rock in the early 1980s, a moment that profoundly shaped his musical direction. Around 1981, when he was about 14, a friend introduced him to the Sex Pistols' album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. The aggressive, raw energy of punk immediately resonated with Kurt, offering a sense of rebellion and authenticity that he had not found in mainstream rock. Soon after, he immersed himself in bands like Black Flag, The Germs, and Dead Kennedys, captivated by their unapologetic sound and anti-establishment lyrics. This newfound passion led him to Aberdeen's small punk scene, where he started attending shows and connecting with like-minded individuals. One of the most influential connections was with the band The Melvins, particularly their frontman Buzz Osborne, who became a key figure in Kurt's introduction to the broader punk community. Kurt regularly hung around the Melvins' practice space, absorbing their sound and learning more about underground music. Punk rock gave him a sense of belonging, a voice for his frustrations, and the inspiration to start experimenting with his own music, planting the seeds for what would later become Nirvana.
