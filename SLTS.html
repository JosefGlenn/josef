               <p align="justify">"Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana is one of the most iconic rock songs of all time, credited with bringing grunge into the mainstream. Released in 1991 as the lead single from Nevermind, it became an anthem for a disaffected generation. The title came from a joke between Kurt Cobain and his friend Kathleen Hanna of the punk band Bikini Kill. One night, after drinking and goofing around, Hanna spray-painted "Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit" on his wall. Cobain didn’t realize that Teen Spirit was actually a brand of deodorant used by his then-girlfriend, Tobi Vail. Thinking it had a deeper, revolutionary meaning, he used it as the song's title.<br><br>

Musically, Smells Like Teen Spirit was influenced by the Pixies, a band Cobain admired for their quiet-loud dynamics. He wanted to write the "ultimate pop song" while maintaining a raw, aggressive sound. The song’s lyrics are famously cryptic, filled with disillusionment, apathy, and rebellion, themes that resonated deeply with young people in the early ‘90s. The track’s explosive chorus, featuring the now-famous lines "Here we are now, entertain us", captured a sense of frustration and alienation.<br><br>

The song’s impact was enormous. When Nevermind unexpectedly overtook Michael Jackson’s Dangerous on the charts, it signaled a shift in popular music, making alternative rock the dominant genre of the decade. Nirvana, and Cobain in particular, became reluctant spokespeople for a generation, something Cobain struggled with until his tragic death in 1994. Despite his discomfort with its popularity, Smells Like Teen Spirit remains a defining song of its era, continuing to influence rock music and culture today.
